# Description of the feature

(Describe what you want to see change, and why this is a good idea)  
*Ex: As a developer, when using many `if` statements, I would like to be able to chain them using `elif`. The current syntax doesn't support this in a readable way.*

# Describe alternatives you've considered (if any)

(Have you considered doing without this feature? How?)  
*Ex: The same behavior can be achieved currently doing something like:*
```
if condition1:
    ...
else:
    if contition2:
    ...
    end
end
```
