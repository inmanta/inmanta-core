  Previously all unknown handling was done in the server. This resulted in strange reporting as the number of managed resource
  could go up and down. Now, an additional resource state "undefined" is introduced. This  state is handled similar to skipped
  during deploys. Undefined resources are undeployable.
- Undeployable resources are now already marked as finished at the moment a version is released or a dryrun is requested.
  Resources that depend on resources in an undeployable state will be skipped on the server as well.
- Sort index attributes: This patch ensure that std::File(host, path) and std::File(path, host) are the same indexes.
