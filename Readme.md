Inmanta is an automation and orchestration tool to efficiently deploy and manage your software services, including all (inter)dependencies to other services and the underpinning infrastructure. It eliminates the complexity of managing large-scale, heterogeneous infrastructures and highly distributed systems.

The key characteristics of Inmanta are:
 * Integrated: Inmanta integrates configuration management and orchestration into a single tool, taking infrastructure as code to a whole new level.
 * Powerful configuration model: Infrastructure and application services are described using a high-level configuration model that allows the definition of (an unlimited amount of) your own entities and abstraction levels. It works from a single source, which can be tested, versioned, evolved and reused.
 * Dependency management: Inmanta's configuration model describes all the relations between and dependencies to other services, packages, underpinning platforms and infrastructure services. This enables efficient deployment as well as provides an holistic view on your applications, environments and infrastructure.
 * End-to-end compliance: The architecture of your software service drives the configuration, guaranteeing consistency across the entire stack and throughout distributed systems at any time. This compliance with the architecture can be achieved thanks to the integrated management approach and the configuration model using dependencies. 

Currently, the Inmanta project is mainly developed and maintained by Inmanta NV.

## Install 

```
git clone https://github.com/inmanta/inmanta.git
sudo ./setup.py install
```

## [Quickstart](https://github.com/inmanta/quickstart-vagrant)

To quickly get started with Inmanta, use Vagrant to set up an environment to host the Inmanta server and some machines to be managed. 
Before starting this tutorial, first [install Vagrant on your machine](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/). 

 
Next, grab the Vagrant box from our Git repo and let Vagrant do the setup of the Inmanta server.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/inmanta/quickstart-vagrant.git
cd quickstart-vagrant
./make_keys.sh
vagrant up
```

Vagrant will set up the Inmanta server and two VMs to experiment on.
When Vagrant is ready, you should be able to open the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8888.  

To get a shell on the Inmanta server:

    vagrant ssh server


### Create an Inmanta project

An Inmanta project bundles modules that contain configuration information. A project is nothing more
than a directory with a project.yml file, which contains parameters such as the location to search for
modules and where to find the server. 

Here we will create an Inmanta project called ``quickstart``, with a basic configuration file.

    mkdir quickstart
    cd quickstart
    cat > project.yml <<EOF
    name: quickstart
    modulepath: libs
    downloadpath: libs
    repo: https://github.com/inmanta/
    description: A quickstart project that installs a drupal website.
    EOF

    
The configuration file ``project.yml`` defines that reusable modules are stored in ``libs``. 

In the next section we will use existing modules to deploy our LAMP stack.

### Reuse existing modules


At GitHub, we host modules to setup and manage many systems. Our modules are available in the https://github.com/inmanta/ repositories.

When you use an import statement in your model, Inmanta downloads these modules and their dependencies automatically. 


### The configuration model


In this section we will use the configuration concepts defined in the existing modules to set up a Drupal website on the host named ``vm1``.

First, create a new ``main.cf`` file:

    import ip
    import redhat
    import apache
    import mysql
    import web
    import drupal

    # define the machine we want to deploy Drupal on
    vm1=ip::Host(name="vm1", os=redhat::fedora23, ip="192.168.33.101")

    # add a mysql and apache http server
    web_server=apache::Server(host=vm1)
    mysql_server=mysql::Server(host=vm1)

    # deploy drupal in that virtual host
    name=web::Alias(hostname="localhost")
    db=mysql::Database(server=mysql_server, name="drupal_test", user="drupal_test",
                       password="Str0ng-P433w0rd")
    drupal::Application(name=name, container=web_server, database=db, admin_user="admin",
                        admin_password="test", admin_email="admin@example.com", site_name="localhost")


* Lines 1-6 import all required packages.  
* Line 9 defines on which host we want to deploy Drupal. 
 * The *name* attribute is the hostname of the machine, which is later used to determine what configuration needs to be deployed on which machine. 
 * The *os* attribute defines which operating system this server runs. This is used to select the right tools (yum, dnf or apt).
 * The *ip* attribute is the IP address of this host. At this moment we define this attribute manually, later in the tutorial we let Inmanta discover this automatically.
* Lines 12 and 13 deploy an Apache server and MySQL server on our host.
* Line 16 defines the name (hostname) of the web application.
* Lines 17-18 define a database for our Drupal website.
* Lines 19-20 define the actual Drupal application.



### Deploy the configuration model

To deploy this configuration model, we must first register it with the Inmanta server, by creating a project and an environment. This can be done via the dashboard, or via the CLI. 
For the CLI:

    inmanta-cli project-create -n test
    inmanta-cli environment-create  -n test -p test -r $(pwd) -b master --save
    

The ``--save`` option tells ``inmanta-cli`` to store the environment config in the ``.inmanta`` file. The compiler uses this file to find the server and to export to the right environment.
	
Then compile the project and send it to the server:

    inmanta -vvv  export
    
The first time you run this command may take a while, as all dependencies are downloaded.  When it is done, go to the [dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:8888).  

Go to your environment, and press Deploy.

To immediately deploy the configuration model using the CLI, add the option ``-d``:

    inmanta -vvv export -d

### Accessing your new Drupal server


When the install is done, you can access your new Drupal server at <http://localhost:8080/>.
