  deprecation-note: "{{description}}. As an alternative to the now-removed 'inmanta module install' command,
  users should follow the updated procedure for module installation:
  The new method involves using the 'inmanta module build' command followed by 'pip install ./dist/<dist-package>' to
  build a module from source and install the distribution package, respectively. Alternatively, use 'pip install -e .'
  to install the module in editable mode"
