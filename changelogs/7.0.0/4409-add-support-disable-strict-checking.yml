description: Add support to enable/disable strict dependency checking in the compiler and in the module tools using the --strict-deps-check and --no-strict-deps-check options.

  upgrade-note: "The compiler and the module tools now by default check all dependencies transitively for version conflicts. When a version conflict is found, an error is raised. A fallback to the old behavior is possible by providing the `--no-strict-deps-check` option."
