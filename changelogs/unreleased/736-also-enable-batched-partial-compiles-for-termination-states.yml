description: >
  Resource sets marked for deletion should no longer be passed via the ``--delete-resource-set`` parameter of the
  ``export`` command. These resource sets should be passed via the ``ENV_REMOVED_SET_ID`` environment variable as
  a space-separated list. The ``--delete-resource-set`` parameter of the ``export`` command is now a flag to control
  resource set deletion.
