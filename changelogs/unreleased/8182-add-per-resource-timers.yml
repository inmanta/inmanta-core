description: >
  Add support for periodic per-resource deploys and repairs.
  When ``AUTOSTART_AGENT_REPAIR_INTERVAL``  or ``AUTOSTART_AGENT_DEPLOY_INTERVAL`` are specified as a number (not a cron epxression), they are interpreted on a per-resource basis. The timer will trigger after the interval has expired, after the last deploy of each individual resource.
