description: >
  Add support for periodic per-resource deploys and repairs.
  When specified as a number of seconds, the ``AUTOSTART_AGENT_REPAIR_INTERVAL`` environment setting will now be
  interpreted on a per-resource basis and ensure that no more than this many seconds go by between two repairs.
  When specified as a string, a cron-like expression is expected and will periodically trigger a global
  repair i.e. for all the resources at once.
  Similarly, the ``AUTOSTART_AGENT_DEPLOY_INTERVAL`` environment setting can be used to set a periodic deploy
  trigger on a per-resource basis.
