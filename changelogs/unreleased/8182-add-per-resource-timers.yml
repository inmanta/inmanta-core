description: >
  Add support for periodic per-resource deploys and repairs.
  When specified as a number of seconds, the ``config.agent-repair-interval`` agent config option will now be
  interpreted on a per-resource basis and ensure that no more than this many seconds go by between two repairs.
  Similarly, the ``config.agent-deploy-interval`` agent config option can be used to set a periodic deploy
  trigger on a per-resource basis.
