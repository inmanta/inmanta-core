  upgrade-note: >
    The new resource scheduler uses a database connection pool of its own.
    Please review the following connection pool environment settings and make sure they fit your
    needs for each of your active environments: [SCHEDULER_DB_CONNECTION_POOL_MIN_SIZE,SCHEDULER_DB_CONNECTION_POOL_MAX_SIZE,SCHEDULER_DB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT]
  deprecation-note: >
    The following settings are being deprecated: [``database.connection_pool_max_size``, ``database.connection_pool_min_size``, ``database.connection_timeout``].
    Please use their respective new counterparts [``database.service_connection_pool_max_size``, ``database.service_connection_pool_min_size``, ``database.service_connection_timeout``]
    to set the database pool size for the server.
