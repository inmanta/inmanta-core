description: Add distinct database pool connection settings for server and scheduler.
issue-nr: 8193
change-type: major
destination-branches: [master]
sections:
  upgrade-note: >
    Previously, a single database connection pool was shared among the server and the agent configured
    via the ``database.connection_pool_max_size`` and ``database.connection_pool_min_size`` options.
    For each environment, the new resource scheduler uses a database connection pool of its own.
    Please review the following connection pool options and make sure they fit your
    needs for each of your active environments:
      - For the scheduler: ["agent.db_connection_timeout", agent.db_connection_pool_max_size", agent.db_connection_pool_min_size"]
      - For the server: [``database.service_connection_pool_max_size``, ``database.service_connection_pool_min_size``, ``database.connection_timeout``]

  deprecation-note: >
    The following settings are being deprecated: [``database.connection_pool_max_size``, ``database.connection_pool_min_size``].
    Please use their respective new counterparts [``database.service_connection_pool_max_size``, ``database.service_connection_pool_min_size``]
    to set the database connection pool size for the server.
