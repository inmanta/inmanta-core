  upgrade-note: |
    The deployment status can only be correctly determined for the current moment.
    For this reason the ``deployed`` and ``status`` field has been removed for all but the latest active version.

    | api endpoint | change | alternative |
    | ------------ | ------ | ------------|
    | `GET /api/v1/version` | removal of the `deployed` and `result` fields from the response | `GET /api/v2/resource/` |
    | `GET /api/v1/version/<id>` | removal of the `deployed` and `result` fields from the response | `GET /api/v2/resource` |
    | `POST /api/v1/version/<id>` | removal of the `deployed` and `result` fields from the response |  `GET /api/v2/resource` |

    | command | change |
    |---------| ------ |
    | `inmanta-cli version release` | removal of the "Deployed" and "# Done" columns from the output and "State" field now reports the same state as the corresponding page in the web-console |
    | `inmanta-cli version list` | removal of the "Deployed" and "# Done" columns from the output and "State" field now reports the same state as the corresponding page in the web-console |
