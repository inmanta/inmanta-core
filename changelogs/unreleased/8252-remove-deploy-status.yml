    The fields `deployed` and `result` have been removed from all API endpoint and tools that report on versions.
    Deploy status information is no longer maintained for individual versions, but only for the latest, active version.

    | ------------ | ------ | ------------|
    | `GET /api/v1/version` | removal of the `deployed` and `result` fields from the response | `GET /api/v2/resource/` |
    | `GET /api/v1/version/<id>` | removal of the `deployed` and `result` fields from the response | `GET /api/v2/resource` |
    | `POST /api/v1/version/<id>` | removal of the `deployed` and `result` fields from the response |  `GET /api/v2/resource` |

    | command | change |
    |---------| ------ |
    | `inmanta-cli version release` | removal of the "Deployed" and "# Done" columns from the output and "State" field now reports the same state as the corresponding page in the web-console |
