description: Integrate local executor completely
change-type: major
destination-branches: [master]
sections:
  upgrade-note: "Handlers can now access the agent via 'inmanta.agent.executor.AgentInstance' instead of `inmanta.agent.agent.AgentInstance`. If you have developed a handler using `self._agent` to access agent internals, it may break."
