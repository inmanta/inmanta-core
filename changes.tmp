tentative:
    - string format raises exception on reference
    - attribute access on attr that happens to be reference raises exception
    - attribute access on valid (explicit in dataclass or explicit in access) reference attribute returns reference, not proxy
    - plugins now properly validate Ref[Dataclass] vs Dataclass
    - support inheritance for dataclasses, both for registering them and on the plugin boundary -> map instance-to-dataclass rather than entity-to-dataclass
    - Ref[DC] passed to plugin now results in a proper reference. Only coerced when plugin does not accept references and dataclass supports it
    - fix breaking bug on unions involving a dataclass
