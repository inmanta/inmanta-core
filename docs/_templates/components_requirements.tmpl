    Inmanta core and extension versions
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The orchestrator is constituted of several components (python packages and npm packages).
    The python packages are of two types: one core package and several extension packages.


    The following table shows the ranges of the Inmanta Python components, this product version is compatible with.
    The lower bound of these version constraints will remain the same for the whole lifetime of this major version. Upper bounds may be added when a new major version is released.

    This table is only meant as a reference for developers of Inmanta extensions and is meant to be used as input to a
    dependency resolver e.g. pip to ensure the resulting versions are compatible.
    This information is not relevant when installing the orchestrator via RPM as is recommended
    in the :ref:`install-server` section.

    .. list-table:: Inmanta core and extensions versions
       :header-rows: 1

       * - .. centered:: Component
         - .. centered:: Required version

       {% for key, value in data["component_requirements"] | dictsort %}
       * - .. centered:: {{ key }}
         - .. centered:: {{ value }}
       {% endfor %}

    .. note::

        This information is also available as a constraints file in `requirements.components.txt <./requirements.components.txt>`_
        and in json format in the `compatibility.json <./compatibility.json>`_ file.

    Python components are not pinned for major version |version_major| because it is not released yet.
