Inmanta core and extensions versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The orchestrator is constituted of several components (python packages and npm packages).
The python packages are of two types: one core package and several extension packages.

{% if data['component_requirements']%}

The following table shows the ranges of the Inmanta Python components, this product version is compatible with.
These compatible versions are defined for the whole lifetime of this major version i.e.
they are not pinned to a specific three-digit version. Upper bounds may be added when a new major version is released.

This table is only meant as a reference for developers of Inmanta extensions. This information is not relevant
when installing the orchestrator via RPM as is recommended in the :ref:`install-server` section.

.. list-table:: Inmanta core and extensions versions
   :header-rows: 1

   * - .. centered:: Component
     - .. centered:: Required version

   {% for key, value in data["component_requirements"] | dictsort %}
   * - .. centered:: {{ key }}
     - .. centered:: {{ value }}
   {% endfor %}

.. note::

    This information is also available as a constraints file in `requirements.components.txt <./requirements.components.txt>`_
    and in json format in the `compatibility.json <./compatibility.json>`_ file.

Python components are not pinned for major version |version_major| because it is not released yet.
