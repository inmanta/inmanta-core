# Workspace support in the Inmanta vs-code extension

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: [HugoT, Sander, Arnaud]
* Date: 2023-03-13

Technical Story: [Original ticket](https://github.com/inmanta/vscode-inmanta/issues/892)

## Context and Problem Statement

When working in a workspace, multiple Inmanta projects and/or modules can be opened at the same time.
Some official guidelines are provided [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Adopting-Multi-Root-Workspace-APIs#single-language-server-or-server-per-folder)
to help guide the choice of having one language server for all the folders, or one language server per folder.

## Decision Drivers

* We want the functionalities offered by the Inmanta extension when working on a single project or module to work
seamlessly when working in a workspace.
* We want to make sure independent projects or modules are isolated from each other and don't pollute each other's
Python environments.

## Considered Options

1. one language server for all the folders
2. one language server per folder
3. one language server per venv

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: option 2, because it is the best compromise between allowing isolation between folders when desired and
ease of implementation.

When a `.cf` file is opened, we mimick the behaviour of the pylance extension:
- If the top-most folder this file belongs to is already being watched by a language server -> Nothing to do
- Else -> We need to start a new language server for this folder using :
  - Case 1: a venv for this folder has already been selected in the past and persisted by vs code in the persistent
storage ==> we simply use this venv and start a new language server. Relevant documentation [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/wiki/Setting-descriptions#experience).

  - Case 2: this is a fresh folder with no pre-selected venv
      * if a workspace-wide venv has been selected -> use this one
      * use the default environment used by the python extension: the interpreter with the highest version amongst [interpreters](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_where-the-extension-looks-for-environments).

NOTE: A check is performed to make sure the interpreted used is not a globally installed one

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### [option 1]

* Bad, because there is no isolation between folders. All dependencies would be installed in the same venv. This might
be a desired behaviour in some cases, but is not acceptable in most cases. e.g. Two projects with different python or
compiler version. Similarly, issues with incompatible requirements between projects could also arise.
* Good, because a single server is started.

### [option 2]

* Good, because there is isolation between folders as long as different venvs are selected.
* Good, because it still allows folders to share a venv if desired, by selecting the same venv.
* Good, because of ease of implementation: each language server is responsible for only one folder and doesn't need to
listen to changes to the workspace. The extension is the one responsible for listening to the changes to the workspace
and starting/stopping language servers as needed.
* Bad, because resource-hungry: one server is started per folder.


### [option 3]

* Good, because there is isolation between folders as long as different venvs are selected.
* Good, because less resource-hungry than option 2: one server is started per virtual environment.
* Bad, because harder to implement than option 2.
* Bad, because more resource-hungry than option 1: one server is started per virtual environment.
