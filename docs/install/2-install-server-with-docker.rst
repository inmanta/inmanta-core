Install Inmanta with Docker
***************************

This page explains how to setup an orchestration server using docker.
This guide assumes you already have `docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_ and `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_ installed on your machine.

Pull the image
##############

.. only:: oss

    Use docker pull to get the desired image:

    .. code-block:: sh

        docker pull ghcr.io/inmanta/orchestrator:2022


    This command will pull the latest version of the Inmanta OSS Orchestrator image.

.. only:: iso

    Step 1: Log in to Cloudsmith registry
    -------------------------------------

    Connect to the Cloudsmith registry using your entitlement token.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ docker login containers.inmanta.com
        Username: inmanta/containers
        Password: <your-entitlement-token>

        Login Succeeded
        $


    Replace ``<your-entitlement-token>`` with the entitlement token provided with your license.


    Step 2: Pull the image
    ----------------------

    Use docker pull to get the desired image:

    .. code-block:: sh

        docker pull containers.inmanta.com/containers/service-orchestrator:7


    This command will pull the latest version of the Inmanta Service Orchestrator image.

Start the server with docker-compose
####################################

Here is a minimalistic docker-compose file content that can be used to deploy the server on your machine.



.. only:: oss

    .. code-block:: yaml

            inmanta-server:

                image: containers.inmanta.com/containers/service-orchestrator:7
                ports:
                    - 8888:8888
                volumes:
                    - ./resources/com.inmanta.license:/etc/inmanta/license/com.inmanta.license
                    - ./resources/com.inmanta.jwe:/etc/inmanta/license/com.inmanta.jwe
                networks:
                    inm_net:
                        ipv4_address: 172.30.0.3
                depends_on:
                    - "postgres"
                command: "server --wait-for-host inmanta_db --wait-for-port 5432"

        networks:
            inm_net:
                ipam:

You can paste this script in a file named `docker-compose.yml` and ensure you have you license files available.
With the proposed config, they should be located in a ``resources/`` folder on the side of the docker-compose file you create,
and the license files should be named ``com.inmanta.license`` and ``com.inmanta.jwe``. You can of course update the content
of the docker-compose file to match your current configuration.
Then bring the containers up by running the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    docker-compose up

You should be able to reach the orchestrator to this address: `http://172.30.0.3:8888 <http://172.30.0.3:8888>`_.

The default server config included in the container images assumes that the orchestrator can reach a database server
with hostname ``inmanta_db`` and that it can authenticate to it using the username ``inmanta``
and password ``inmanta``.
When using a different setup than the one mentioned above, you should overwrite the server config with one
matching your needs.  You can find more instructions for overwriting the config in a following section,
:ref:`here<docker_overwrite_server_conf>`.

.. warning::
    We don't recommend using the setup described above as a production environment.  Hosting a database in a
    container as shown here is not ideal in term of performance, reliability and raises some serious data
    persistence concerns.


.. _docker_overwrite_server_conf:

Overwrite default server configuration
######################################

By default the server will use the file located in the image at ``/etc/inmanta/inmanta.cfg``.
If you want to change it, you can copy this file, edit it, then mount it in the container,
where the original file was located.

If you use docker-compose, you can simply update this section of the example above:


.. only:: iso

    .. code-block:: yaml

        inmanta-server:
            container_name: inmanta_orchestrator
            image: containers.inmanta.com/containers/service-orchestrator:7
            ports:
                - 8888:8888
            volumes:
                - ./resources/com.inmanta.license:/etc/inmanta/license/com.inmanta.license
                - ./resources/com.inmanta.jwe:/etc/inmanta/license/com.inmanta.jwe
                - ./resources/my-server-conf.cfg:/etc/inmanta/inmanta.cfg

.. only:: oss

    .. code-block:: yaml

        inmanta-server:
            container_name: inmanta_orchestrator
            image: ghcr.io/inmanta/orchestrator:2022
            ports:
                - 8888:8888
            volumes:
                - ./resources/my-server-conf.cfg:/etc/inmanta/inmanta.cfg


Starting the ssh server
#######################

By default, no ssh server is running in the container.  You don't need it to have a functional
orchestrator.
If you want to enable ssh anyway, for easy access to the orchestrator,
you can overwrite the startup command of the container with the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    server-with-ssh


If you use docker-compose, it should look like:

.. code-block:: yaml

    inmanta-server:
        container_name: inmanta_orchestrator
        ...
        command: "server-with-ssh"

.. warning::
    By default, the inmanta user doesn't have any password, if you want to ssh into the container,
    you also need to set the authorized_keys file for the inmanta user.  You can do so by mounting
    your public key to the following path in the container: ``/var/lib/inmanta/.ssh/authorized_keys``.
    When starting, the container will make sure that the file has the correct ownership and permissions.


Waiting for the database
########################

Depending on you setup, you might want your container to wait for the database to be ready
to accept connections before starting the server (as this one would fail, trying to reach
the db).
You can do this by adding the following arguments to the startup command of the container:

.. code-block:: sh

    server --wait-for-host <your-db-host> --wait-for-port <your-db-port>


If you use docker-compose, it should look like:

.. code-block:: yaml

    inmanta-server:
        container_name: inmanta_orchestrator
        ...
        command: "server --wait-for-host <your-db-host> --wait-for-port <your-db-port>"


Setting environment variables
#############################

You might want your inmanta server to be able to reach some environment variables.
There are two ways you can achieve this:
 1. Set the environment variables with docker, either using the ``--env`` argument or in your
    docker-compose file.  Those variables will be accessible to the inmanta server and any
    agent it starts, but not to any other process running in the container (if you for example
    login via ssh to the container and try to install a project again).
 2. (Recommended) Set the environment variables in a file and mount it to the following path in the
    container: ``/etc/inmanta/env``.  This file will be loaded when starting the server and for
    every session that the inmanta user starts in the container.

.. only:: oss

    .. code-block:: yaml

        inmanta-server:
            container_name: inmanta_orchestrator
            image: ghcr.io/inmanta/orchestrator:2022
            ports:
                - 8888:8888
            volumes:
                - ./resources/my-server-conf.cfg:/etc/inmanta/inmanta.cfg
                - ./resources/my-env-file:/etc/inmanta/env

.. only:: iso

    .. code-block:: yaml

        inmanta-server:
            container_name: inmanta_orchestrator
            image: containers.inmanta.com/containers/service-orchestrator:7
            ports:
                - 8888:8888
            volumes:
                - ./resources/com.inmanta.license:/etc/inmanta/license/com.inmanta.license
                - ./resources/com.inmanta.jwe:/etc/inmanta/license/com.inmanta.jwe
                - ./resources/my-server-conf.cfg:/etc/inmanta/inmanta.cfg
                - ./resources/my-env-file:/etc/inmanta/env


Changing inmanta user/group id
##############################

If you mount a folder of your host in the container, and expect the inmanta user to interact with it,
you might face the issue that the inmanta user inside the container doesn't have ownership of the files.
You could fix this by changing the ownership in the container, but this change would also be reflected
on the host, meaning that you would lose the ownership of you files.  This is a very uncomfortable
situation.
While ``Podman`` has been offering the possibility to do a mapping of a user id in the container to a
user id on the host at runtime, which would solve our problem here, ``Docker`` still doesn't offer this
functionality.
The inmanta container allows you to change the user and group id of the inmanta user inside the
container when starting the container to match the user on the host, getting rid that way of any
conflict in the files ownership.

This can be done easily by simply setting those environment variables:
 - ``INMANTA_UID``: Will change, when starting the container, the id of the inmanta user.
 - ``INMANTA_GID``: Will change, when starting the container, the id of the inmanta group.

If you use docker-compose, you can simply update this section of the example above:

.. code-block:: yaml

    inmanta-server:
        container_name: inmanta_orchestrator
        ...
        environment:
            INMANTA_UID: 1000
            INMANTA_GID: 1000


Log rotation
############

By default, the container won't do any log rotation, to let you the choice of dealing with the logs
according to your own preferences.  We recommend that you do so by mounting a folder inside of the container
at the following path: ``/var/log``. This path contains all the logs of inmanta (unless you specified
a different path in the config of the server) and the logs of the SSH server.
