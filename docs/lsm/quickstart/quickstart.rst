LSM quickstart
**************

This document provides a quickstart for the Inmanta lifecycle service manager (LSM). A high-level overview will be given on how
Inmanta LSM can be used to model and provision new services within a certain infrastructure. This quickstart considers a basic
service, which creates and updates the IP of a given interface.


Overview setup
##############

The figure shown below, gives an overview of the infrastructure required to execute this quickstart.
The infrastructure consists of:

1. An Inmanta Service Orchestrator with LSM
2. Three SR Linux routers (spine, leaf1, leaf2)
3. An internet connection


.. image:: images/setup.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Overview setup

The SR Linux routers in this guide are setup as a 3-node CLOS network with a spine and two leaf switches.
``mgmt`` is the management interface of the SR Linux routers and the Inmanta Service Orchestrator making them reachable over the management network (172.30.0.0/24).

The service modelled in the following section manages the association of IP-addresses to any interface of the SR Linux routers.

Orchestration model
###################

The full orchestration model to assign an IP-address to an interface of a SR Linux router, is shown below.

                    auto_agent = true,
                    name = self.router_name,
                    mgmt_ip = self.router_ip,
                    yang_credentials = yang::Credentials(

            service_entity_name="interface-ip-assignment",

        for assignment in lsm::all(binding):

        end


* Lines 1 to 7 import several modules required by this configuration model.
* Lines 9 to 26 define the API of the new service, i.e. the attributes required to instantiate a new instance of the
  service. The `InterfaceIPAssignment` entity defines four attributes: `router_ip`, `router_name`, `interface_name` and `address`. Each
  attribute has a description defined in the docstring above. The docstring provides documentation on the meaning of a specific service attribute. The "<attribute>__modifier" fields are
  meta-data fields. They defines whether the attribute can be modified or not. In the above-mentioned orchestration model,
  the  `router_ip`, `router_name` and the `interface_name` attribute can only be set upon instantiation of the model, while the `address`
  attribute can be changed during the lifetime of the service. More information on attribute modifiers can be
  found :ref:`here<attributes_metadata_attribute_modifiers>`.
* Line 28 defines which implementation should be used to instantiate the `InterfaceIPAssignment` service entity.
* Lines 30 to 65 provide the actual implementation for the `InterfaceIPAssignment` service entity. If an instance is created of the
  `InterfaceIPAssignment` service entity, this implementation will make sure that the `address` specified in the attributes of the
  service instance, will be configured on the requested interface and SR Linux router. 
* Lines 42 to 47 in particular, are where the resource is instantiated and assigned to the `resources` field. 
  The `resources` field should contain the list of `resources` that need to be deployed before the state of the instance can be moved from *creating* to *up*.
* Lines 68 to 72 create a service entity binding. It associates a name and a lifecycle to the `InterfaceIPAssignment` service entity
  and registers it in the Inmanta Service Orchestrator via its northbound API. More information on service lifecycles can be
  found :ref:`here<lifecycle>`.
* Lines 75 to 83 create an instance of the `InterfaceIPAssignment` entity for each service instance. The ``lsm::all()`` plugin
  retrieves all the service instances via the Inmanta Service Orchestrator API.


Install the orchestration model onto the Inmanta server
#######################################################

Go back to the previous folder and :ref:`create an Inmanta project and environment<inenv>`.

.. code-block::

    # Create a project called test
    $ inmanta-cli --host 172.30.0.3 project create -n test
    # Create an environment called lsm-srlinux
    $ inmanta-cli --host 172.30.0.3 environment create -p test -n lsm-srlinux --save


The following command executes a script to copy the required resources to a specific folder inside the container.

.. code-block::

   $ docker exec -ti -w /code clab-srlinux-inmanta-server  /code/setup.sh

Afterwards, open the web-console, in this example it is on http://172.30.0.3:8888/console/. 

.. image:: images/empty-service-catalog.png
    :align: center
    :alt: interface-ip-assignment service in service catalog

Click on the ``Update Service Catalog`` button.
This will make the new ``interface-ip-assignment`` service known by the Inmanta orchestrator,
making it possible to create new instances of this service via the LSM API or via the Inmanta web-console.

Clicking on the button will:

-   Download all required code onto the orchestrator;
-   Install the project;
-   Export the service entity bindings to the service catalog.

After executing these commands, the ``interface-ip-assignment`` service will appear in the service catalog of the Inmanta
web-console as shown in the figure below.

.. image:: images/service-catalog.png
    :align: center
    :alt: interface-ip-assignment service in service catalog

Check that the router is empty
##############################

Login into the SR Linux router named "spine" using the username "admin" and password "admin".

.. code-block::

   $ ssh admin@clab-srlinux-spine

.. note::

    Additional information on how to connect to these containers can be found on the :ref:`quickstart<quickstart_connecting_to_the_containers>`. 
    In this guide we will only do certain commands to show the changes.

Check the interface configuration via the following command. 

.. code-block::

    A:spine# list interface 
        interface ethernet-1/1 {
        }
        interface ethernet-1/2 {
        }
        interface mgmt0 {
            subinterface 0 {
                ipv4 {
                    dhcp-client {
                    }
                }
                ipv6 {
                    dhcp-client {
                    }
                } 
            }
        }


Create a new service instance
#############################

Now, we will provision a new instance of the interface-ip-assignment service via the Inmanta web-console. Click on the *Show inventory*
button after the vlan-assignment service and click on the *Add instance* button.

.. image:: images/add-instance.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Click on the "Add-instance" button

Fill in the required attributes and click on confirm.

.. image:: images/add-instance-form.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Form to create a new service instance

The service will be deployed automatically after clicking the *confirm* button. During the deployment, the service instance
will move through different states of its lifecycle: start -> acknowledged -> creating -> up. When the service is in the up
state, the interface is configured successfully. Verify the configuration on the SR Linux "spine" router.

.. code-block::

    A:spine# list interface 
        interface ethernet-1/1 {
            subinterface 0 {
                ipv4 {
                    address 10.0.0.4/16 {
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        interface ethernet-1/2 {
        }
        interface mgmt0 {
            subinterface 0 {
                ipv4 {
                    dhcp-client {
                    }
                }
                ipv6 {
                    dhcp-client {
                    }
                }
            }
        }
