Impera's documentation
======================

Impera is a configuration management tool for managing complex and large-scale distributed systems in
an integrated manner. It is based on the `research of iMinds-DistriNet into configuration management
<https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/453199/1/thesis.pdf>`_. The tool and companion
configuration modules are available on the GitHub project site: https://github.com/impera-io.

The documentation is work in progress and should grow and improve considerably in a short time
frame.
