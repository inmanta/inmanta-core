    -- add and populate resource_set table --

    -- Table does not really contain any data. We could have in-lined the name in the resource_set_configuration_model table
    -- but that would decrease the relational integrity because null values are not allowed to reference another table.
    --
    -- The performance of the two approaches was tested by setting up a database with 5000 model versions, with 5000 distinct
    -- resource sets each, with names the same across all model versions. This represents the (assumed) worst case scenario
    -- when it comes to performance.
    -- Performance was then tested for the query that copies resource sets (no resources) from one version to the next.
    -- The in-line approach performed slightly better at 60ms vs 70ms. Both scaled roughly linearly with the
    -- size of the test (the 5000 mentioned above). When resources were added to the test, the copy query only accounts for 30%
    -- of the insert time when few and small resource sets are updated. As resource sets in the partial export scale, the
    -- resource insert (not impacted by this decision) dominates to the point where the copy becomes negligible.
    -- Other queries that select a resource set by name and model version are still affected, with the minimal performance hit
    -- described above.
