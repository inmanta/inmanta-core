                For example: `?filter.status=deployed&filter.status=available` returns instances with either of the statuses
                deployed or available.
                Multiple different filters narrow the results however (they are treated as an 'AND' operator).
                For example `filter.status=deployed&filter.agent=internal` returns resources

    :param sort: Return the results sorted according to the parameter value.
                It should follow the pattern `<attribute_to_sort_by>.<order>`, for example `resource_type.desc`

                The following sorting attributes are supported: 'resource_type', 'agent', 'resource_id_value', 'status'.

                For example `filter.minimal_log_level=INFO&filter.action=deploy` returns logs

                minimal_log_level: filter by the log level of the log messages. The filter specifies the minimal level,
