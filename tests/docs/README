This folder contains test cases that are used to build the documentation or perform tests on it. They are placed under the `./tests` folder to make sure that all the fixtures from the inmanta-core test suite are available. The names of these `.py` files intentionally don't have the format `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` to prevent them from being picked up when the tests of the inmanta-core test suite are run.
